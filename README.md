## Install a Swift 5 Snapshot

For this to work, you need to have Swift 5 installed.
As of today Swift 5 hasn't been released yet, but Apple is providing
prebuilt Swift 5 development toolchains over at:
[swift.org](https://swift.org/download/#swift-50-development),
and you can also use the 
[Xcode 10.2beta](https://developer.apple.com/download/).
Just install the toolchain, and select it in the Xcode "Toolchains" menu:

If you are living on the commandline, make sure to call 
`export TOOLCHAINS=swift` to get access to the selected version.

To try out the samples below, you can either open a Swift 5 Playground or create
a command line tool project project in Xcode.
